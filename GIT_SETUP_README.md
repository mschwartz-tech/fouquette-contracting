# Git Setup and Push Guide for Fouquette Contracting Website

## Problem Identified
Your Git repository push issues were caused by:
1. **Git not in PATH** - PowerShell couldn't find the `git` command
2. **Missing user configuration** - Git needs your name and email for commits
3. **Batch file PATH issues** - The original scripts didn't handle Git paths properly

## Solution Files Created

### 🚀 `git-complete-setup.bat` (RECOMMENDED)
**This is your main file to use going forward.**

Features:
- ✅ Automatically finds and configures Git
- ✅ Sets up user identity if needed
- ✅ Checks repository status
- ✅ Commits and pushes changes
- ✅ Provides detailed error messages and troubleshooting

**How to use:**
1. Double-click `git-complete-setup.bat`
2. Follow the prompts if it asks for your name/email
3. The script will handle everything else automatically

### 📝 `git-config.bat`
Use this if you only need to set up your Git user configuration:
- Sets your name and email for Git commits
- Only needs to be run once

### 🔧 `git-fix-and-push.bat`
Alternative push script with basic functionality

## Current Repository Status
Based on the analysis:
- ✅ Git is installed at `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe`
- ✅ Repository is properly initialized and connected to GitHub
- ⚠️ User configuration needs to be set up (name/email)
- 📝 You have staged changes ready to commit:
  - Modified: `index.html`, `netlify.toml`, `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`
  - New: `public/manifest.json`, `src/components/SEO/SEOHelmet.tsx`

## Quick Start
1. **Run the main setup**: Double-click `git-complete-setup.bat`
2. **Enter your details** when prompted (first time only)
3. **Your changes will be committed and pushed automatically**

## Troubleshooting

### If push fails with authentication error:
1. **Option 1 (Easiest)**: Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and sign in
2. **Option 2**: Set up a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
3. **Option 3**: Use SSH keys

### If you get "not a git repository" error:
- Make sure you're running the batch file from the project folder
- The folder should contain a `.git` folder

### For PowerShell users:
If you prefer using PowerShell directly, you can add Git to your PATH permanently:
```powershell
$env:PATH += ";C:\Program Files\Git\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd"
```

## Files You Can Delete
After testing the new setup, you can delete:
- `git-setup-and-push.bat` (old version)
- `git-push-with-gh-cli.bat` (old version)

## Next Steps
1. Test the `git-complete-setup.bat` file
2. Once working, you can use it anytime to push changes
3. Your Netlify deployment should automatically update when changes are pushed to GitHub
