    "question": "What types of payment do you accept?",
    "answer": "We accept multiple payment methods including checks, credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), and electronic transfers. For larger projects, we typically request a deposit (25-33% of the total project cost) to secure your place in our schedule and cover initial material costs. The balance is due upon completion of the project and your satisfaction with the work. For commercial clients, we can discuss net payment terms as needed."

    "question": "How do I maintain my masonry work after completion?",
    "answer": "Masonry work is generally low maintenance, but some basic care will extend its life and appearance. For most masonry, we recommend an annual inspection to identify any issues like cracked mortar or settling. Patios and walkways should be swept regularly and cleaned yearly with a mild detergent. We advise against power washing unless done by professionals with proper pressure settings. For specific materials like natural stone or concrete pavers, we'll provide detailed care instructions after installation. Additionally, we offer maintenance services for clients who prefer professional upkeep."

    "question": "Do you provide warranties on your masonry work?",
    "answer": "Yes, Fouquette Contracting stands behind our craftsmanship with a comprehensive warranty. We provide a 2-year warranty on workmanship for most projects, covering issues related to installation or construction. This is in addition to any manufacturer warranties on materials used. Our warranty covers structural issues, settling beyond normal parameters, and installation-related defects. We'll promptly address any warranty concerns and make necessary repairs at no cost to you during the warranty period."

    "question": "Can you match existing brickwork or stonework for repairs?",
    "answer": "Yes, matching existing masonry is one of our specialties. We have extensive experience in sourcing bricks, stones, and mortar to match older or discontinued products. Our process includes detailed photography, measurements, and sometimes sample removals to ensure the best possible match. For historic properties or unique materials, we work with specialty suppliers to find or create appropriate matches. While perfect matches can be challenging with aged masonry, our skilled techniques minimize visible differences between new and existing work."

    "question": "What is the best time of year for masonry projects in Minnesota?",
    "answer": "In Minnesota, the ideal season for masonry work is late spring through early fall (May through October). This period typically offers the most favorable conditions with appropriate temperatures for mortar curing and minimal precipitation. However, we can perform many types of masonry work year-round with proper precautions. Winter work may require temporary heating and enclosures, which can add to project costs. For optimal scheduling and potentially better pricing, we recommend booking your project during our less busy seasons (early spring or late fall)."

    "question": "Do I need permits for my masonry project?",
    "answer": "Permit requirements vary by location and project type. Generally, structural work like retaining walls over certain heights (typically 4 feet), new foundations, or projects affecting load-bearing structures require permits. Cosmetic work like veneers, patios, or small repairs typically don't require permits. As part of our service, we'll research the specific requirements for your project location and handle the permit application process when needed. We ensure all work meets or exceeds local building codes regardless of permit requirements."

    "question": "What's the difference between concrete pavers and natural stone for patios?",
    "answer": "Both materials have distinct advantages. Concrete pavers offer consistency in size and color, are typically more affordable, and provide excellent durability with less maintenance. They're available in many styles, including those that mimic natural stone. Natural stone (like bluestone or flagstone) provides unique character with natural variations, generally higher property value enhancement, and an authentic, timeless appearance. Natural stone may require more maintenance and is usually more expensive. During consultation, we'll discuss your aesthetic preferences, budget, and lifestyle needs to recommend the best option for your project."
